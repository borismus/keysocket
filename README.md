**Unoffical Version**
Just created a fork to merge in pull requests for smaller, less popular music players since the [official repo](https://github.com/borismus/keysocket) has decided not include these anymore for reasons of maintainability.  Use this extension at your own risk.  To install do the following:

1. Check out this repo
2. Go to Chrome > Settings > Extensions
3. If you already have Key Socket Media Keys installed then disable it now
4. At the top of the page check the box that says `Developer Mode`
5. Click the button that says `Load unpacked extension...` 
6. Navigate to where you checked out the Git repo, it might be something like `C:\Users\Me\Git\keysocket\extension`
7. Click `ok`
8. * scroll to the bottom & click `Keyboard shortcuts`
9. find `Keysocket Media Keys` and change each desired key to `Global`
10. Use the extension like normal but hopefully with support for some bonus music players :)

Global keyboard bindings to control your Chrome-based music player. Allows your keyboard media keys (play/pause, next, previous) to work when you're listening to music on common streaming websites.

**UPDATE: Now uses Chrome's built in key binding (as of version 25)**
